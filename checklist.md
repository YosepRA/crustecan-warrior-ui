# UI Checklist

Random thoughts and concerns while on development. Finished items will have âœ… mark beside it.

- Think of a better `key` for seat selection checkout page.
- Show price for each seat order in seat selection checkout page.
- Create a checkout summary table.
- Enable route protection on checkout page.
- Use semantic HTML tags for components.
- Checkout payment method choice to use actual radio input for accessibility. Including keyboard interaction such as focus and tabbable.
- Login page to use redirect to "previous page" instead of explicit dashboard page redirect.
- Checkout seat selection validations. Unless the data are valid, keep them in seat selection page and away from payment page.
  - No empty field.
  - No same seat.
- Global notification system.
- Global loading page system.
- Work on the footer.
- Search page input to use search glass icon as input adornment.
- Search page input to have small cross icon button to reset the field.
